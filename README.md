# Feikbuk
In this Hackaton we developed a videogame in: Godot, our videogame was called: "Feikbuk".
The objective of this game was to relate real situations that happen in Mexico, in order to educate young people and protect them from certain dangers, unfortunately in Mexico the education on social media is null, for this reason young people are very prone to fall into unfavorable situations.

Feikbuk told the story of Maria, which is an ordinary person who is curious to enter a social network, because she wants to interact with her friends and family, she chooses Feikbuk.
The user is introduced to an interface very similar to the Facebook platform, all in pixel art, the mechanics of the game is very simple, it is a game of decisions, so you choose dialogue A or dialogue B, depending on the dialogue you choose the story changes.

Now that you are inside the game, you will receive requests for friendship, there are three requests that stand out, and based on the one you choose will be the story that the character will live.
The game touches on very strong themes, however it is not explicit, as it is aimed at a young audience.
The first story is about sexual abuse, another one about online fraud and the last one about sexting, rape and death.

The user can choose to ignore the profile that sends messages, and unlock the good ending.
However the user can also choose dialogues that lead to the bad ending, unfortunately these stories are true and the game presents you with the real documented cases at the end.
